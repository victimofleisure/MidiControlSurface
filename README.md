# MidiControlSurface

This Windows app provides a basic MIDI control surface. It's organized as a list of row dialogs. Each row can be configured to send a specified MIDI event on a specified channel. Each row also contains a slider, an edit box, and a button. The output device is selected via a combo box in the tool bar.

The app is currently limited to a single row, but the intention is to allow rows to be added, deleted, and reordered.
